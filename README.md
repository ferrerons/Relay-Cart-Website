==About RelayCart==
RelayCart was developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Jquery. The code for each pages 
are contained in their respective folders. Images are placed in the "img" folder, and the
images used in our "index.html" page can be found under img > home-img folder.

This website is designed solely to showcase our designed mobile app RelayCart which
is for workers that shop and deliver groceries as part-time or full-time job.
